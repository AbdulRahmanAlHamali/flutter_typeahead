/// # Flutter TypeAhead
/// A TypeAhead widget for Flutter, where you can show suggestions to
/// users as they type
///
/// ## Features
/// * Shows suggestions in an overlay that floats on top of other widgets
/// * Allows you to specify what the suggestions will look like through a
/// builder function
/// * Allows you to specify what happens when the user taps a suggestion
/// * Accepts all the parameters that traditional TextFields accept, like
/// decoration, custom TextEditingController, text styling, etc.
/// * Provides two versions, a normal version and a [FormField](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/FormField-class.html)
/// version that accepts validation, submitting, etc.
/// * Provides high customizability; you can customize the suggestion box decoration,
/// the loading bar, the animation, the debounce duration, etc.
///
/// ## Installation
/// See the [installation instructions on pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_typeahead#-installing-tab-).
///
/// ## Usage examples
/// You can import the package with:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:flutter_typeahead/flutter_typeahead.dart';
/// ```
///
/// and then use it as follows:
///
/// ### Example 1:
/// ```dart
/// TypeAheadField(
///   textFieldConfiguration: TextFieldConfiguration(
///     autofocus: true,
///     style: DefaultTextStyle.of(context).style.copyWith(
///       fontStyle: FontStyle.italic
///     ),
///     decoration: InputDecoration(
///       border: OutlineInputBorder()
///     )
///   ),
///   suggestionsCallback: (pattern) async {
///     return await BackendService.getSuggestions(pattern);
///   },
///   itemBuilder: (context, suggestion) {
///     return ListTile(
///       leading: Icon(Icons.shopping_cart),
///       title: Text(suggestion['name']),
///       subtitle: Text('\$${suggestion['price']}'),
///     );
///   },
///   onSuggestionSelected: (suggestion) {
///     Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(
///       builder: (context) => ProductPage(product: suggestion)
///     ));
///   },
/// )
/// ```
/// In the code above, the `textFieldConfiguration` property allows us to
/// configure the displayed `TextField` as we want. In this example, we are
/// configuring the `autofocus`, `style` and `decoration` properties.
///
/// The `suggestionsCallback` is called with the search string that the user
/// types, and is expected to return a `List` of data either synchronously or
/// asynchronously. In this example, we are calling an asynchronous function
/// called `BackendService.getSuggestions` which fetches the list of
/// suggestions.
///
/// The `itemBuilder` is called to build a widget for each suggestion.
/// In this example, we build a simple `ListTile` that shows the name and the
/// price of the item. Please note that you shouldn't provide an `onTap`
/// callback here. The TypeAhead widget takes care of that.
///
/// The `onSuggestionSelected` is a callback called when the user taps a
/// suggestion. In this example, when the user taps a
/// suggestion, we navigate to a page that shows us the information of the
/// tapped product.
///
/// ### Example 2:
/// Here's another example, where we use the TypeAheadFormField inside a `Form`:
/// ```dart
/// final GlobalKey<FormState> _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
/// final TextEditingController _typeAheadController = TextEditingController();
/// String _selectedCity;
/// ...
/// Form(
///   key: this._formKey,
///   child: Padding(
///     padding: EdgeInsets.all(32.0),
///     child: Column(
///       children: <Widget>[
///         Text(
///           'What is your favorite city?'
///         ),
///         TypeAheadFormField(
///           textFieldConfiguration: TextFieldConfiguration(
///             controller: this._typeAheadController,
///             decoration: InputDecoration(
///               labelText: 'City'
///             )
///           ),
///           suggestionsCallback: (pattern) {
///             return CitiesService.getSuggestions(pattern);
///           },
///           itemBuilder: (context, suggestion) {
///             return ListTile(
///               title: Text(suggestion),
///             );
///           },
///           transitionBuilder: (context, suggestionsBox, controller) {
///             return suggestionsBox;
///           },
///           onSuggestionSelected: (suggestion) {
///             this._typeAheadController.text = suggestion;
///           },
///           validator: (value) {
///             if (value.isEmpty) {
///               return 'Please select a city';
///             }
///           },
///           onSaved: (value) => this._selectedCity = value,
///         ),
///         SizedBox(height: 10.0,),
///         RaisedButton(
///           child: Text('Submit'),
///           onPressed: () {
///             if (this._formKey.currentState.validate()) {
///               this._formKey.currentState.save();
///               Scaffold.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(
///                 content: Text('Your Favorite City is ${this._selectedCity}')
///               ));
///             }
///           },
///         )
///       ],
///     ),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
/// Here, we assign to the `controller` property of the `textFieldConfiguration`
/// a `TextEditingController` that we call `_typeAheadController`.
/// We use this controller in the `onSuggestionSelected` callback to set the
/// value of the `TextField` to the selected suggestion.
///
/// The `validator` callback can be used like any `FormField.validator`
/// function. In our example, it checks whether a value has been entered,
/// and displays an error message if not. The `onSaved` callback is used to
/// save the value of the field to the `_selectedCity` member variable.
///
/// The `transitionBuilder` allows us to customize the animation of the
/// suggestion box. In this example, we are returning the suggestionsBox
/// immediately, meaning that we don't want any animation.
///
/// ## Customizations
/// TypeAhead widgets consist of a TextField and a suggestion box that shows
/// as the user types. Both are highly customizable
///
/// ### Customizing the TextField
/// You can customize the text field using the `textFieldConfiguration` property.
/// You provide this property with an instance of `TextFieldConfiguration`,
/// which allows you to configure all the usual properties of `TextField`, like
/// `decoration`, `style`, `controller`, `focusNode`, `autofocus`, `enabled`,
/// etc.
///
/// ### Customizing the Suggestions Box
/// TypeAhead provides default configurations for the suggestions box. You can,
/// however, override most of them.
///
/// #### Customizing the loader, the error and the "no items found" message
/// You can use the [loadingBuilder], [errorBuilder] and [noItemsFoundBuilder] to
/// customize their corresponding widgets. For example, to show a custom error
/// widget:
/// ```dart
/// errorBuilder: (BuildContext context, Object error) =>
///   Text(
///     '$error',
///     style: TextStyle(
///       color: Theme.of(context).errorColor
///     )
///   )
/// ```
/// #### Customizing the animation
/// You can customize the suggestion box animation through 3 parameters: the
/// `animationDuration`, the `animationStart`, and the `transitionBuilder`.
///
/// The `animationDuration` specifies how long the animation should take, while the
/// `animationStart` specified what point (between 0.0 and 1.0) the animation
/// should start from. The `transitionBuilder` accepts the `suggestionsBox` and
/// `animationController` as parameters, and should return a widget that uses
/// the `animationController` to animate the display of the `suggestionsBox`.
/// For example:
/// ```dart
/// transitionBuilder: (context, suggestionsBox, animationController) =>
///   FadeTransition(
///     child: suggestionsBox,
///     opacity: CurvedAnimation(
///       parent: animationController,
///       curve: Curves.fastOutSlowIn
///     ),
///   )
/// ```
/// This uses [FadeTransition](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/FadeTransition-class.html)
/// to fade the `suggestionsBox` into the view. Note how the
/// `animationController` was provided as the parent of the animation.
///
/// In order to fully remove the animation, `transitionBuilder` should simply
/// return the `suggestionsBox`. This callback could also be used to wrap the
/// `suggestionsBox` with any desired widgets, not necessarily for animation.
///
/// #### Customizing the debounce duration
/// The suggestions box does not fire for each character the user types. Instead,
/// we wait until the user is idle for a duration of time, and then call the
/// `suggestionsCallback`. The duration defaults to 300 milliseconds, but can be
/// configured using the `debounceDuration` parameter.
///
/// #### Customizing the offset of the suggestions box
/// By default, the suggestions box is displayed 5 pixels below the `TextField`.
/// You can change this by changing the `suggestionsBoxVerticalOffset` property.
///
/// #### Customizing the decoration of the suggestions box
/// You can also customize the decoration of the suggestions box using the
/// `suggestionsBoxDecoration` property. For example, to remove the elevation
/// of the suggestions box, you can write:
/// ```dart
/// suggestionsBoxDecoration: SuggestionsBoxDecoration(
///   elevation: 0.0
/// )
/// ```
