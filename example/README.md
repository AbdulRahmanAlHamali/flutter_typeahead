See the [readme](../README.md) in the root of the repository for more information.

To run the example, generate the files for your platform:

```bash
cd example # if you are not in the example directory
flutter create . --platform=<platform> # where <platform> is any of [android, ios, linux, macos, web, windows]
```

Then compile and run the example as usual:

```bash
flutter run
```
